 This is a folder to store personal Python scripts, which could be load when the program starts up.
 
 ### Introduction:
 1. copy your python script (.py, .pyc, .pyd, .pyw) to this folder
 2. then enter the name (one file per line) of the file which you want to load into 'config\import list.cfg'.
 
 for example, import my_file_a.py and my_file_b.py into the software, modify the file config\import list.cfg' to
 ```
my_file_a
my_file_b
 ```
  
  if you want to use them in the software, the namespace of your file is your file name.
  
  ### remember, DO NOT INCLUDE SPACE IN YOUR FILE NAME!!!!!!
