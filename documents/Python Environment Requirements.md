# Python Environment Requirements

**Run Datanalyze in a custom Python Environment is NOT recommended.**

**If you do so, you may encounter unexpected BUG or the software may not
run normally.** 

**Do not do so unless you want to develop or debug Datanalyze. If you use
a operating system other than windows, run Datanalyze in your own 
environment instead of using Wine or install windows is the least
recommended choice.**
